# Shore to Core to Shore Tax Increment Financing District

This project aims to walk a user through how the introduction of a TIF in Cleveland aims to change the landscape of downtown Cleveland. The TIF aims to fund public infrastructure projects along the lakefront, in the core of downtown, and along the riverfront. The project currently does not have any interactive mapping components on City of Cleveland websites, and I believe that an interactive mapping experience could enhance understanding of the project for Cleveland residents and interested viewers. 

This project uses Mapbox.gljs and includes HTML, CSS, and Javascript files (along with GEOJSON files from the City of Cleveland) to build an interactive experience for the user. Users can scroll through the map (often referred to as scrollytelling) and be taken on a journey to better understand what TIFs are and how they work. Rendered images along the lakeshore, in the core, and along the riverfront are included to provide opportunities for the user to understand future changes. The map concludes with some thoughts around how the City should think about opportunities to support longtime residents.
